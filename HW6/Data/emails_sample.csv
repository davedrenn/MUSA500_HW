Just to clarify, its not the relative age of the production date, but the age 
of the event itself.

Subject: purge of old Contract_Event_Status

Scotty/Richard,

Our DBAs would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in 
Contract_Event_Status.  We have over 1 Gig of data in that table.  I would 
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any 
row with a Last_Mod_Date over a month (or two) old.  So if someone balances 
February 1999 this month, we will keep it around for a month (or two).

Does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter/longer period 
of time?

This is not an audit table.  This is just a ""log"" every nom/track/balance/EDI 
send/Fax send/sched qty/quick response since the beginning of time.

d.n.

How is everything at home?  We would like to come by this week to see the 
three of you.  I am sorry we couldn't come by last weekend, but we were all 
sick.  Jake continues to be a walking virus.  Talk to you later this week.

Dear Ken:

News stories abound almost daily over the alleged need for
governments to proscribe various foods, beverages, cell phones, and
much more.  Yet, Americans are healthier and live longer than ever.
So, what is the real story here?

As a result, I am very pleased to invite you to attend the upcoming
Independent Policy Forum reception and seminar, ""PUBLIC HEALTH vs.
THE NANNY STATE?""

http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/001026ipf.html

This program will feature syndicated columnist and Reason Magazine
senior editor, JACOB SULLUM, author of the book, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
and economist THOMAS DiLORENZO, co-author of the new book, FROM
PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS.

The program will be held Thursday evening, October 26th, from 6:30 to
8:30 p.m., at the Independent Institute's conference center in
Oakland, California.

For your review, I am adding below an invitation with further details
on the program.  Since seating is limited, please make your
reservations as soon as possible.  For further information, please
contact me or the Institute's Events Coordinator, Ms. Nichelle
Beardsley, at 510-632-1366 X118.

We hope to see you on October 26.

Sincerely,

David J. Theroux

PUBLIC HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)
http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/001026ipf.html

Barely a day goes by without some news of the latest public health
""threat."" Serious health hazards, we are told, lurk around every
corner -- in water supplies, air, soil, beverages, fast food,
second-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation, just to
name a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are
markets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are
these dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for
government control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without
government dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about
public health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the growing
Nanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and
responsibility? JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these
timely and important issues.

SPEAKERS:

      - Jacob Sullum (Syndicated Columnist and Senior Editor, Reason
magazine; Author, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD)

      - Thomas DiLorenzo (Professor of Economics, Loyola College of
Maryland; Co-author, FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in
America)

WHEN:
       Thursday, October 26, 2000
       Reception and book signing: 6:30 p.m.
       Program: 7:00 - 8:30 p.m.

WHERE:
       The Independent Institute Conference Center
       100 Swan Way
       Oakland, CA 94621-1428
       For a map and directions, see
       http://www.independent.org/tii/tii_info/about.html#map

TICKETS:
       $30.00 per person: includes one copy of either Jacob Sullum's
book, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, or Thomas DiLorenzo's book, FROM PATHOLOGY
TO POLITICS.
       OR, admission without a book is $10 per person ($7 for
Independent Institute Associate Members)


About FOR YOUR OWN GOOD:

""Sullum is meticulously logical, and his conclusions are implicit in
everything he argues. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD has made us think about
totalitarianism in this most unlikely context.""
      - NEW YORK TIMES

""Intriguing and worthwhile, this book marshals an impressive array of
facts and arguments. Thoughtful and articulate.""
      - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

About FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in America:

""FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS argues that public health has become a
bureaucracy that feels the need to perpetuate itself by expanding
into new areas that are more often than not, just plain 'politically
correct.'""
      - WALL STREET JOURNAL

priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really 
shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the 
predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.  

One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new 
product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated 
basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated 
basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec 
Nymex.  Any ideas?"

Subject:	Hobbs System Conversation -- Gas Control Meeting, 11/20

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26""Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

Yes, I had already approved them for trading without any restrictions.  When 
I got the signed master in, it just meant that the confirmations now took a 
different path.

Something that yall will find helpful... I've been working with the Lotus 
Notes people in upgrading our current Master Swap Agreement database, and 
once its finalized we will be opening view access to anyone who wants it.  I 
am adding drop downs for ""approved for online trading"", so you will be able 
to confirm our approval, als, contract information which is currently 
provided on a monthly basis will now be available at all times.  I think 
other groups that rely on our contract information, Credit, Settlements, 
Global Contracts, EOL, dealmakers, or anyone else (at ECT or ECT Canada for 
confidentiality purposes) will now be able to be seeing what we're seeing in 
terms of the financial contacts.

I was told my prototype would be done by the end of the week, and then we'll 
have to test it, but hopefully this information will be available soon.  I 
hope this is helpful!"

I wasn't clear if the new B-1 is supposed to supplement or replace the old 
B-1.  It is up to you as to which specifications you think are pertinent.  
That gets a bit more technical than what I'm capable of judging.  You might 
want to give the old stuff the once over to make sure there isn't anything 
which in a worse case scenario you might miss having in there.

On February 14, 2000, Enron North America (Enron) filed a declaratory 
judgment action against the Tennessee Valley Authority (""TVA"") in the Federal 
District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Chattanooga Division, 
requesting that the court determine whether TVA defaulted under its power 
purchase agreement with Enron by failing to pay undisputed invoices.  On 
March 6, TVA filed a counterclaim against Enron alleging that Enron 
wrongfully terminated the power purchase agreement.  Although no assurances 
can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results

It's really an ""either - or"" situation in that either the bid is set up to request wholesale power with the utility retaining the customer or as a retail transaction in which we bid for the customers.  The only way to have both is if we allow the utilities to decide this issue themselves, in which case, FE, DPL and Allegheny will go the wholesale route and AEP and Cinergy will go the retail route.  The problem is also giving too much control to the utilities to game the outcomes in favor of their perceived business interests and those of their affiliates.  EES obviously wants it to be retail.  And from an ENA perspective, the wholesale power delivered under the utilities' proposals would have to be load-shaped, which may not interest ENA as much.  We are in the EES vs. ENA question, but under my reading of the statute, it requires a retail bid as my comments indicate.

At the conclusion of the meeting on competitive bidding, parties were encouraged to file comments at the PUCO.  Below is a draft that reflects the subjects discussed and where I think we ought to land, based on our meeting earlier this week.  I would like to file these soon, so please get back to me.

In the meeting there was a lot of discussion on the RFP process.  Of course the utilities wanted to be able to draft the RFP, choose the winning bidder, have their affiliates participate in the process and have very scanty PUCO oversight, all of which I fought vigourously.  I was asked however if Enron could provide info on what should and should not be in an RFP.  On the should part, I said we could probably provide some insights, but that the should not category would probably be a ""I know it when I see it"" call.  Having said that, any input on this question would be appreciated.

Does the first option need to expire or can we terminate prior to expiration

legal fees.   If we are going to pay a flat fee and renegotiate this 
agreement, I think we need to do so quickly.   Regardless, I need to tell 
them something soon.  They are getting desparate.  I've a call in to Taffy

Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you 
add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.  
If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance 
sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain 
that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you 
would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one 
thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are 
with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before 
it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then 
you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.

Subject: RE: AEW's backup

Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the 
accountants?

Only the memorandum of option was recorded.

I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning 
to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve 
some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too 
long to address the immediate issue.

I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let 
the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment 
would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it 
would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.

Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm 
just wondering what is public info.

Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his 
vote.  

More to come...

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions 
and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this 
this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it 
together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies 
of our accounting requirements.

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is 
that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, 
which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it 
is one thought.  What do you think?

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning 
from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?

Kay,

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy 
Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is 
Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been 
told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they 
gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of 
enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann 
Elizabeth is out?

Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011-49-8218-89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011-49-8232-8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

Subject: Revised Contract Approval Request - Phillips Petroleum Company

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Phillips Petroleum Company's discount letter was recently approved by 
Transwestern's Officer group.   However, Phillips has now requested that 
Transwestern include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that Transwestern's minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to Phillips).  The inclusion of this language would 
require Transwestern to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  Transwestern would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
approval.

Hi Guys

How are you all. We arrived about three weeks ago, and I started work about 
two weeks ago - I got plenty to do. 

We are doing good, Milo had trouble with the jet lag initially, which meant 
that we weren't affected by if since he didn't let us sleep. Kate is a bit 
homesick as she is having trouble making friends with the baby and all, but 
we'll work it out. 

We are staying in a temporary place. rents here are just as bad as in SF but 
we will eventually find a place.

London is cool apart from the whether. Its as if someone from every nation is 
living in  this city.

Hope all of you are good.

my phone # here is 44 20 7783 4661

Take care 

Bruno

U.S. warplanes attacked Taliban targets along Afghanistan's border with
Tajikistan for the first time in an attempt to take out artillery used to
disrupt a Northern Alliance supply route.

For the first time since 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court won't be hearing
cases in its historic chambers, after anthrax was discovered at a facility
that sorts the high court's mail.

The FBI has found no traces of anthrax in cars owned by two Sept. 11

Georgi,
There is an executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  However, we are currently negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement to replace the old agreement.  That is why you see the status as ""draft sent"" - it is a draft of the new agreement that has been sent.

I am still working on this audit and I have found in Legal's Financial Lotus Notes tracking system that Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., created by Lisa Wheeler on 2/23/97, the status says ""Draft Sent"".  
 
It should be changed to ""Executed"" since there is an executed copy of their Master Energy Price Swap Agreement in Livelink.  This particular Morgan Stanley's Contract number is 95000191, CP #9409.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

As I'm sure you were  both otherwise occupied, you probably missed my boy in action this  afternoon.  He was on what he  termed a ""power walk (catchy, don't you think?),"" going door to door with  power-saving light bulbs, which he was handing out free of charge to  ""emphasize our need to conserve energy.""

At Lisa Mellencamp's request I am sending you the amendment agreements that 
we have drafted with respect to the physical and financial masters between 
KCS and Enron.  Drafts of these agreements were sent to Harry Stout earlier 
this week and some changes have been made since then.  I am enclosing both 
clean and marked copies.  If you have any questions, please call me or Lisa.  
My number is 853-3989.

I'm glad you like your gifts.  I got tired of waiting on my assistant so I 
took up sewing (for Hector) and metal working type stuff for your goodies.  
I'm helping Joanie move to Maryland this weekend.  I'm out Friday, Monday, 
and Tuesday.  

AND I've been putting photo's on the web.  I bought a digital camera.  Take a 
look .  Go to ==>  http://www.cartogra.com/home/home.asp
Then go to the box in the bottom right side of the screen where it says ""new 
to cartogra?"".  Enter my account name ""trogg522"" in the space beneath and 
click on the arrow.

Later :o)

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not be 
at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of the 
afternoon.

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon.? 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both.

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up the 
Enron part.

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and catchup.? 
:) 

Take care.?? ii

Rod:
Fred has requested that we send him a draft ISDA with a zero threshold for an 
affiliate of KCS Energy.  He also requested that we amend the setoff language 
in the KCS ISDA Master to include this affiliate and KCS Resources.  As you 
know, Lisa has been working with KCS' counsel to come up with a pleading that 
would be approved by the bankruptcy judge in the KCS Energy bankruptcy matter 
that would give us the protection that we need to do short term trades with 
KCS while they are in bankruptcy.  KCS' counsel has been very slow to respond 
and it wasn't until late last week that we received from feedback from them 
which Lisa will be reviewing.  We are perplexed by Fred's latest request and 
want to know what we should be doing in response to his request.  As you 
know, amending the setoff language to include affiliates is not the same as 
entering into a ""master netting agreement"" with KCS or their affiliates.

We have also received a request from Susan Wood in risk management who was 
interested in finding out more about trading with ""bankrupt"" counterparties.  
She said that she was working with Fred on this.  Again, is this something 
that credit intends to pursue and if so, under what circumstances?

Both of the above matters will involve a considerable amount of time and 
effort on legals part and before we spent alot of time on it, we wanted some 
indication from credit that these matters were worth pursuing.

This is a follow-up to?the October 5 meeting on the AAA's  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? One of the most exciting aspects of  that meeting was 
the enthusiasm for the systems and services we are developing  to support the 
Protocol.? We are now at the stage in which we need to get  direct feedback 
from potential users, and I am putting together a working group  to look at 
several aspects of our efforts, including:
?
??? - The mechanics and timelines of the  services
??? - The qualifications of arbitrators and  mediators
??? - Integration and data transfer  issues
??? - Dispute tracking events
??? - Incorporating adjunct services to  offer?a complete dispute management 
process
?
At the meeting you expressed interest and?support for  our?proposed 
services?and how they might benefit Enron.? Enron's  involvement?in 
developing and refining our services would be invaluable to  us, and if?there 
is someone at Enron who could  participate in our efforts, please let me 
know.? Alternatively, you can  simply forward this message to them?and they 
could get in touch with  me.
?
Should you have any questions, you can reach me by e-mail 
(gstrathmann@mediaone.net) or  telephone (978-376-9004).
?
Thank you.

		 Subject: CA Emissions/Environmental Issues

Steve - We were hoping to provide a chart that plotted out the NOx emissions 
from existing fossil fuel generation vs, new cleaner generation.  This chart 
is not quite there.  However, it is a rough aggregate of the NOx generated by 
all of the existing fossil fuel generation over 50 MW in CA.  The data points 
were gathered from the EPA's Acid Rain CEMs (continuous emissions monitoring) 
database.  (I am working on a chart that's message is more clear.) As you 
will see, existing generation is significantly dirtier than what new, 
combined cycle plants would be.  In fact, of the utility units in CA 
reporting under Title IV, there are a number of steam plants with NOx 
emissions of 0.1 lb/MMBtu or in some cases more.  This corresponds to about 1 
lb NOx/MWh compared to 0.056 lb/MWh for a new gas combined cycle plant.  Even 
the cleaner boilers that are at 0.05 lb/MMBtu are 10 times higher than the 
new plants on an output basis.  

In otherwords, Dave Parquet is right that there is a lot of more polluting 
generation on line, while new plants have to meet ever tighter BACT 
requirements.



In the most recent version of SB 28 it looks like there are a lot of 
provisions focusing on the retrofitting of existing generation.  I suspect, 
the regulators are well aware of the discrepancies in emissions and would 
argue that the plants are going to have to clean up in the very near future.  
I am digging for more information on these timelines.

Gus, Marc, and I felt like the main short term fixes/solutions would be:

1.  Expanding the hours of operations for back-up generators.  (As I have 
previously stated, some of the local air districts have increased the 
permitted run hours for emergency generators from 200 to 500 at only 
""essential public services."")  

2.  CA requiring offsetting of emissions at only the ratios required by 
Federal regulations.  In many cases state requirements are more stringent.

3.  The EPA allowing the concept of the pollution mitigation bank - it is 
really going to be an issue of timing - once the CA government has the funds 
to start acquiring offsets they will be able to provide them prior to the 
operation of a new generation facility, However, there is going to be some 
initial lag time where the offsets aren't in the hands of the generation 
operators (which goes against the requirements of the Clean Air Act).

4.  The Feds working with the state and local permitters to create alternate 
sources of emission offsets.  There simply aren't enough in all the air 
districts.  As I stated, in my previous memo the USEPA has allowed, under the 
NOx SIP call, emissions allowances to be given to renewable and energy 
efficiency projects. CA is going to need guidance from the USEPA in how to 
create and count alternate sources of offsets in nonattainment areas.

5.  The USEPA better defining the nonattainment air sheds and pollution 
transportation pathways.  Apparently, there is not a central model of the air 
patterns in CA.  Thus, the 35 local air districts all having different 
requirements about inter-district offsets.

However, the real issues as Dave alluded to in his memo are going to require 
modifications to the Clean Air Act.  It is pretty prescriptive about what can 
and can't be done, and there is not a whole lot of flexibility.  

Let me know if anything in here is not clear.  I'm working on refining the 
data and presentation of the data.

Attention: MR.  STEVE  KEAN
  MS.  CINDY  OLSON    =20

Dear Mr. Kean and Ms. Olson:

I am privileged and delighted for providing me with this opportunity of=20
writing directly to both of you, while I am on re-deployment status.

The purpose of this letter is to respectfully appeal to both of you to plea=
se=20
help me continue serving Enron and continue being an active manager within=
=20
this most challenging environment, as I feel I am most qualified.

I joined Enron EE&CC on March 1, 2000; now am an EES employee. I am a=20
Mechanical Engineer, with 32 years work experience and extraordinary track=
=20
record in the oil & gas and power generation EPC business worldwide, with=
=20
major global organizations. =20

I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (specifically in the Gas Turbines=
=20
Technology). I have been a Project Manager, Senior Project Manager, and=20
Project Director on major multi-million Dollar onshore and offshore=20
development projects since 1980, in every hydrocarbons  producing region.

I was interviewed at Enron=01,s EE&CC in mid February 2000 pursuant to my=
=20
application for Project Manager/Senior Project Manager position. =20

I was then hired on March 1, 2000 as Project Engineering Manager (PEM), und=
er=20
quite urgent circumstances, to be in charge of all three (3) major and most=
=20
active Power Projects at EE&CC in Brazil.  Just one (1) week later, after m=
y=20
new hires orientation, I had to join a delegation and travel to Brazil for=
=20
Due Diligence of Local Engineering and Construction Contractors. =20

The Expected NTP was January 2001, and the life of these foreign Projects=
=20
(except for Electrobolt =01) simple cycle plant) is three (3) to four (4) y=
ears,=20
i.e. until the year 2003 and 2004.  These Projects are RioGen, Cuiaba II, a=
nd=20
Electrobolt.

I was attracted to Enron due to its standing and recognition in the industr=
y,=20
reputation, globalization, and active market penetration.  In fact, I felt=
=20
very fortunate to become the center of the above-mentioned challenges with=
=20
three such major Enron Power Projects.

I resigned my then current and very secure position as Senior Project Manag=
er=20
at Solar Turbines Incorporated (a Caterpillar company), after almost 6=20
successful years, where I was entrusted with Solar=01,s major turnkey power=
 and=20
gas compression projects, worldwide.=20

My prime objective and priority then, when I accepted to work for Enron wer=
e,=20
clearly, to tackle and continue with the new challenges that Enron offered =
me=20
until the year 2003 =01) 2004. =20

However, I am still very optimistic and hopeful that, with your kind suppor=
t,=20
I am hoping to receive due consideration of this appeal.

I have already interviewed with Messrs. Steve Meyers and Dave Roberts at EE=
S,=20
and both believe that they are certainly in need of a strong technical pers=
on=20
like myself, but no confirmation has been received yet.

I have also applied to at least fifteen (15) pertinent positions within EES=
,=20
ENA, and Enron Transportation but, unfortunately, have received no response=
=20
yet.

Nevertheless, I am most certain that you do not want to loose a knowledgeab=
le=20
and active member of your team, and I am most confident that you can assist=
=20
placing me in a position where I can contribute most positively to Enron=01=
,s=20
continued success and profitability.

Sincerely,

Adel

Paul Radous asked me to get in touch with you in connection with a proposed 
ISDA Master Agreement with Kellog Supply Services (Europe) Limited.  I should 
be grateful if you would send me by e-mail all documents relating to the ISDA 
recently executed between ENA and Kellog's as Paul would like us to use 
similar provisions.

In passing, I should point out that both I and my colleague, Michael 
Khajeh-Noori, will be dealing with this matter.  I am in the office on 
Mondays and Tuesdays and Michael is in the office on Thursdays and Fridays.  
I should therefore be grateful if you would address any e-mails to both of us 
(we can both be contacted on the same extension: 34539).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

With kind regards

Deepak

Paul: will you be preparing a credit worksheet for this entity?

We have recently concluded an ISDA with The Kellogg  Company in the USA. Now 
their European entity, Kellogg Supply Services (Europe) Limited of The 
Kellogg Building, Talbot Road, Manchester M19 0PU, UK, would like to see an 
ISDA Mastera and Schedule.

Can you look at this entity from a credit point of view please? I do not have 
separate financials for them, but if you need them will ask for a latest set.

Hello,

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: August 1st

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

I would very much like your help on this.  I agree that we should follow up 
on the others and if it doesn't work, then pursue some Bush people.  the 
evening before for Pres -elect Bush is a good idea too; can yu follow up?

I talked to Phil Cassidy.  The meeting dates cannot be moved, as you probably 
suspected.  I would suggest that we make calls to find out the availability 
of the congressional leaders given that they will likely be in recess.  
Gephardt has already declined.  Once we know their status, we may want to 
consider inviting key members of the Bush Cabinet.  We may want to also 
explore the availability of key Committee Chairs.  Phil also noted that we 
should consider having the President-elect during the evening program of Feb. 
21.  Let me know if you want us to handle next steps from DC.

Also, you should contact Ken's assistant, Rosalee Fleming, to see when would 
be a good time to give ken a briefing and see what else he needs.  I have 
told Rosalee that you are preparing the materials for Ken.

Subject: Dinner with V. Fox

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____"

EPA released their urban strategy for their Air Toxics Program, and they 
listed reciprocating engines as an area source they plan on regulated under 
the MACT regulations for formaldehyde. As you know, an area source is a 
location that emits less than 10 tons of any one Hazardous Air Pollutant 
(HAP) or 25 tons/year of all HAPs. This was a big surprise to industry. 

As expected they also listed oil and gas production as an area source they 
plan on regulating, but did not list transmission and storage dehydration, or 
turbines. They will regulate major sources for HAPs in all of these 
categories.

production effective July 1, 2000.

The only production which we have for July forward should be:
 1.  Braxton Oil & Gas
 2.  Bill Kennedy
 3.  Aurora
I do not want to cancel their contracts untill we are sure that we do not owe 
Equitrans for any past negative imbalances.

Cindi, when you nom for July, let me know the volume and I will try to sell 
the gas to Dominion.

Dear Vince,

      The following message is from co-PI, Prof. Baichun Xiao in Long Island 
University. 
In this message, he told me how Enron would be registered. To my best 
knowledge,
IBM, Lucent and other big companies have registered in NSF for long. 
Your kindly understanding is acknowledged very much. 

     Good weekend,

Dear Youyi:

The person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact
nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration.

FastLane User Support: 1-800-673-6188.
FastLane Availability (Recording): 1-800-437-7408.

After enron is registered (I think it's a free registration), you provide
the following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to nsf.
NSF will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
(called fastlane). Since all proposals have to be submitted through
fastlane after Oct. 1, 2000, this is the must.


Name
Highest Degree
Year Conferred
Present Institution
Department
Street Address
City
State
Zip Code
Social Security Number (SSN)
Email Address
Business Phone Number
Business Fax Number


For more information, you may go to

www.fastlane.nsf.gov/fastlane.htm

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  Logistics needs either a deal to record these volumes which have 
flowed into HPL's  pipeline or Logistics needs approval to writeoff these 
volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to 
Clem Cernosek).  There was no deal at this meter the previous month or the 
later month.

DOWNWARD MARCH

America's Federal Reserve responded to continuing signs of economic
weakness with its eleventh INTEREST-RATE CUT of the year. A reduction
of a quarter-point brings rates down to 1.75%, the lowest for 40 years.

- - - - - See article: Don't bet on a swift recovery
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36738_6723637_1_79944192_60299072_1_69

The value of GLOBAL MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY in 2001 was $1.6
trillion, half what it was worth the previous year, according to data
from Dealogic. In 2000, the inflated value of high-tech shares fuelled
many a deal that now looks unwise.

CSFB is to hand over some of the cash it had made from the dotcom boom.
The investment bank has reportedly agreed to pay $100m to settle an
investigation by America's regulators into claims that it had rigged
initial public offerings of high-tech shares by allocating big tranches
to favoured customers in return for a slice of the profits in the form
of inflated commissions.

ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES reshuffled its top management yet again.
Dinos Iordanou, who had been promoted to head of group operations last
year and was tipped to take over the top job, left to run an insurance
start-up. Perhaps as a result, Converium, a reinsurance business Zurich
has spun off, made a quiet stockmarket debut.

The weak economy claimed more victims at AMERICAN EXPRESS. It announced
that up to 6,500 more jobs would go, on top of the 7,700 announced in
the past 12 months, a total of 15% of its workforce.

COMPAQ'S merger with HEWLETT-PACKARD seemed doomed after the Packard
foundation rejected the deal. Hewlett family members had already
dismissed the merger; together they own 18% of the company. Compaq
shares sank, but both it and HP optimistically insisted that the deal
would succeed with the aid of institutional shareholders.

TELECOM TROUBLES

The global telecoms slump hit Eastern Europe. TELEKOMUNIKACJA POLSKA
announced that it would get rid of 12,000 employees next year, some 20%
of its workforce. France Telecom, which acquired 35% of the former
state monopoly from the Polish government last year, had said that job
cuts would come but had agreed with powerful unions that it would wait
four years.

Struggling BRITISH TELECOM appointed Ben Verwaayen, a Dutchman from
struggling Lucent Technologies, as its new chief executive, to replace
Sir Peter Bonfield, who recently said he would depart from BT a year
ahead of schedule.

NOKIA provided some relief from the gloom surrounding high-tech
companies. The Finnish mobile-phone behemoth announced that
fourth-quarter profits were likely to be better than previously
forecast after handsets sold in greater quantities than expected. But
fourth-quarter profits will not match last year's; and its
infrastructure business still languishes.

CONSIGNIA, once known as Britain's Post Office, may have to lay off
some 30,000 workers over the next year and a half, twice previous
estimates for redundancies needed to save costs as postal growth slips.
Unions reacted to the state-owned company's announcement with outrage
and threatened to strike.

YAHOO!, the world's biggest Internet portal, made an unsolicited offer
of $436m for HOTJOBS, a careers website that was planning to merge with
its rival, TMP Worldwide.

DRUG CULTURE

Corporate Japan suffered its biggest foreign intrusion with the
purchase by ROCHE of a controlling interest in CHUGAI, a large drug
company, for up to YEN198 billion ($1.59 billion). The Swiss drug firm
assuaged Japanese sensitivities by dressing the deal up as an alliance
with Roche as an invited partner.

PFIZER threatened to stop supplying France with new medicines in
protest at the country's drug-pricing policies. It hopes competitors
will join the struggle to squeeze extra cash from France's government;
it would go to research and developing better cures, says Pfizer.

MERCK shocked investors and sent its shares reeling with the news that
profits would not grow in 2002. The American drug firm blamed the
expiry of patents and slowing sales.

FIXING THE CAR MAKER

FIAT unveiled plans for a restructuring that would see the loss of
6,000 jobs, the sale of non-core assets and the possible demise of up
to 18 of its factories. The head of its car-making division, Roberto
Testore, resigned.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36736_6723637_1_79944192_60299072_1_67

Five GERMAN BANKS felt the wrath of the European Commission. In its
latest round of cartel-busting, the commission levied fines of EURO101m
($90.4m) for fixing commissions on the exchange of the 12 euro-area
currencies since 1997. Three banks said they would appeal.

Hi Dale,

I would contact Kathy Clark.  As far as I know, there have been no change 
orders (unless my memory is failing, which is a possibility!).

Kay:  Do you know whether EE&CC has someone keeping watch over the ABB 
transformer contract & associated change orders, and if so, who that might 
be?  I need to get a good read on what CO number we are up to, etc.

Hope things are well with you.

Dale, will you get involved in this change order as well? Hopefully, this one 
will be much simpler than the GE change order since we are just changing 
design parameters for two units on the existing order. Ed has already 
indicated an ok for this added expenditure.

Jody, can you assist again? Sorry, but I will be in Las Vegas again until 
next Wednesday. I'm available by cell phone (503-703-4600) if I need to do 
something on this or there are any questions. The ABB e-mail contains the 
transformer identifier numbers and new parameters. My conference call notes 
of the requested changes are also attached. The total losses for the loss 
guarantee increase from 218 to 240 kW per the attached. The original contract 
is in the file and another copy is on my desk for reference if needed. I 
think all the information is here and just needs to be put into the proper 
format. Thanks.

We confirm that we wish to proceed with the changes as discussed in our 
conference call and described in your e-mail included below. We will promptly 
initiate a change order to the original contract with ABB that included the 
purchase of these two units in the amount of $99,000 (two units at $49,500 
each).

Security Level:?         Internal

Mike,
     As requested, we have looked at the original design of the Enron Las 
Vegas
84/112/140MVA units (SO# LNL9518-1 & -2) and find that we can not be compliant
with the items as described in Don Hammond's conference call notes as shown
below , unless we do a re-design.  We can still build the adjusted units in 
the
original production schedules, given the timely authority to proceed in that 
new
direction.  If the units are built according to the new re-designed 
parameters ,
ABB would have to make the necessary material and performance changes to get 
to
Enron's desired characteristics, especially for the impedance change and the
necessity to perform in a higher ambient temperature.

     Overall this re-design will require a price adder to each of the 2
transformers, of $49,500.00/each .  Key factors in this cost adder would be 
the
engineering re-design effort, the additional radiators required, and the use 
of
high delivery fans.  The overall footprint dimensions and guaranteed 
performance
of the transformer also must be adjusted to meet the new parameters requested 
,
as follows:

Characteristic      New Design           Original Design

H/X Impedance       13%            9%
Ambient Temp        46 degree C          40 degree C
Sound (dBA)         70/72/73       70/72/73
Overall Length      315""           350""
Overall Depth       238            195
Overall Height      232            243
NL Losses(KW)  43             57
Load Losses(KW)     197            161
Total (KW)          240            218
Aux Losses(KW) 9              6.5

     Please provide this data to Enron and confirm that we are to proceed with
this adjustment ASAP, so that we can complete engineering on the new design, 
and
then provide the drawing information that Enron has requested from our 
drafting
department. That drafting effort has been put on hold until these redesign
issues are resolved.  The confirming Enron change notice for the technical and
the monetary changes will also be required.

     Please advise when you think that we will have feedback on these changes
from Enron.
     Thanks
     Frank
